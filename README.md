Tinder for X
============

This is an open source that can be used as a template for the many "Tinder for _____" projects you've been asked to make. Whether you want to make Tinder for Cats, Tinder for Cars, or Tinder for Cabbage, this should make it easier for you to do so.

This app uses Meteor for its backend and its Cordova integration and React for the frontend. We're also using Babel for compiling ES6 to javascript. Most of the styling comes from Ionic.

##Installation

Clone the repo with:

    $ git clone https://github.com/samcorcos/tinder-for-x.git

And there you have it! That's all you need to do.

##Examples
